# Alcohol Tracker

## About
The Alcohol Tracker is a fun and practical application designed as a New Year's gesture for my more drink-inclined friends. After spending an entire semester hacking Go for network and distributed system code, I wanted to explore the GUI capabilities of Golang. Initially, I started with a version built using Fyne, which remains incomplete but may be posted in another repository. Eventually, I transitioned to using Wails, which provided a smoother development experience. Along the way, I also had the opportunity to learn Svelte and revisit JavaScript after a long time.

## Release
The initial version of the Alcohol Tracker is under development and will be released soon. Stay tuned for updates!

## Build
To build and run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd alcohol-tracker
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Ensure you have [Go](https://go.dev/) and [Wails](https://wails.io/) installed.
   - Install required dependencies:
     ```sh
     wails doctor
     ```

3. **Run the Application in Development Mode:**
   ```sh
   wails dev
   ```

4. **Build the Application:**
   ```sh
   wails build
   ```

This will generate the executable that you can use.
